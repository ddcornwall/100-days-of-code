# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: October 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've now completed 56 coding challenges on the Front End Developer track at Free Code Camp (FCC). I learned about creating HTML forms and styling elements with colors. I used this knowledge to create my own simple form on my new Cloud9 account.

**Thoughts** I'm definitely starting to fill gaps in my self-education. While I feel like I've got the basics of HTML, I haven't refreshed my skills in awhile. So the creating forms with simple tags, while something I heard about, wasn't something I had done. It's great to see how easy it is put it together. I still need to learn how to pass the results of a form elsewhere and if I could figure out how to send it an e-mail address this might have direct relavance to a nonprofit I volunteer for. 

Eventually, I'll need to figure out how to get Cloud9 to host my content in a non-preview way, unless that's not something they do.

### Day 1: October 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Learned new border features in CSS

**Thoughts** One challege, putting an image into code gave me fits, not because the code didn't work, but a glitch in FCC check tests didn't work. But going to FCC forum at https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/freecodecamp-challenge-guide-add-images-to-your-website/16640/7 helped me realize the issue wasn't me. Forums are your friend!

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: October 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created Github account, renewed Free Code Camp account.

**Thoughts:** It was interesting to see how the Github repository process worked. Also how you can use the "forget password" functionality on websites to see if you had dabbled in them before. 

**Link to work:** - None
