##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 0: October 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Created Github account, renewed Free Code Camp account.

**Thoughts:** It was interesting to see how the Github repository process worked. Also how you can use the "forget password" functionality on websites to see if you had dabbled in them before. 

**Link to work:** - None


### Day 1: October 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Learned new border features in CSS

**Thoughts** One challege, putting an image into code gave me fits, not because the code didn't work, but a glitch in FCC check tests didn't work. But going to FCC forum at https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/freecodecamp-challenge-guide-add-images-to-your-website/16640/7 helped me realize the issue wasn't me. Forums are your friend!
