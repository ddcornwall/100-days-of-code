### Day 69: December 20, 2017 - Time spent, 1 hour

**Today's Progress**:  Successfully retrieved and addressed data from the Free Code Camp (FCC) weather API. Got it to work on the geolocation of my laptop. 

**Thoughts**: The first part of the day was frustrating and reminded me of the need to track and triple check all punctuation. I also had to relearn that for the most part, what happens in the function stays in the function. Once I got these two truths out of the way, it was a simple matter to use geolocation to generate latitude and longitude to use in retrieving weather data via a $getJSON request. I've satisfied myself that I can reliable address sub-items within the weather data "blob" I get. Now I can move on to which data I want to use and how to display it. Because its an FCC project that directs us to CodePen, I'll probably be setting one up in the next day or two. 

While I'm definitely finding some of the details frustrating, my confidence level in working with APIs is increasing, for which I am grateful.

### Day 68: December 19, 2017 - Time spent, 1 hour

**Today's Progress**:  Kept my patience as I tried different things. 

**Thoughts**: Not much done today. Sort of like a rat in a maze. But better to explore the maze than lie down and give up, right? 

First I tried separating out the javascript and css bits into their own files. I kept a copy of my original HTML file that had both elements in that. Then I constructed new files index.html, style.css and script.js. The separated Javascript file did not work, though I was prepared for that as Google called a script within a script.  But I couldn't make that call work within script.js and after Googling the possibilities, I settled on keeping the javascript inside my index.html file. What stumped me more is that although I triple checked my stylesheet link AND could apparently see it working in developer tools, the map would not unless the styles were inside index.html. I'm sure I'm missing something, but for the life of me can't figure what.

Next I turned my attention to the Free Code Camp (FCC) weather API. It seemed straightforward, but my efforts to use Get JSON seem to break the map. Without the weather API code, it's fine. Drop in the weather API code and all of a suddent "InitMap()" is no longer a function. 

It may be that I bit off more than I can chew. So tomorrow I think I will go back to basics and drop the Google Map for now, even though I'd like to bring it back later.

### Day 67: December 18, 2017 - Time spent, 1 hour

**Today's Progress**:  Figured out how to get geolocation and Google Maps to work together. Started studying the Free Code Camp (FCC) weather API. 

**Thoughts**: Today was mostly tweaking and poking once I found an example of getting Google to take my laptop's location. Worked at getting the right sized map. Looking at the FCC weather API it looks like it's got a lot of good fields to play with. I figure I'm going to try and use the sunrise and sunset data in addition to weather conditions. It would be nice to know what their original source is just because I like vetted resources for applications, but this will do for the exercise.  

I also have some work to do because the examples I used to generate the Google Map based on geolocation ran script and style tags inside the HTML. I think it would be good practice to transfer these out to their own separate script.js and style.css

### Day 66: December 17, 2017 - Time spent, 1 hour

**Today's Progress**:  Completed Free Code Camp (FCC) Wikipedia Viewer. Started planning for Show Local Weather. Obtained a developer key for the Google Maps API.

**Thoughts**: I spent about half my time this morning trying to wrap my brain around using autocomplete and how that would affect the code in my working project. I came to the conclusion that this is a "nice to have", I don't need it right now. So I submitted my Wikipedia Viewer as a completed project to FCC. I figured that the local weather viewer would be a nice way to continue working with different APIs. 

As part of my customization of "Show your local weather", I intend to display an embedded Google Map so people can tell at a glance if their geolocation has gone wonky. For example, while I live in Juneau Alaska, it is not uncommon for geolocation apps to put me in either Anchorage Alaska or even Seattle Washington. So far I have a basic Google Map, but I haven't worked out how to pass the latitude and longitude I get from my laptop into Google's script. But I'm guessing that just means I need a tutorial in HTML5 geolocation.

### Day 65: December 16, 2017 - Time spent, 1 hour

**Today's Progress**:  Made Wikipedia viewer more presentable. Researched ways to implement autocomplete. 

**Thoughts**: 
Today was pretty fun. Mostly tweaking my Wikipedia Viewer that I put into a CodePen because that was the preferred format of Free Code Camp (FCC). I spend the last part of my coding time on reading how to get my search form to autocomplete with wikipedia titles. I feel close but not quite. This partly because finding alone focused time is harder to do at my families place than at home.

### Day 64: December 15, 2017 - Time spent, 1 hour

**Today's Progress**:  Built an unaesthetic working version of the Free Code Camp (FCC) Wikipedia Viewer. 

**Thoughts**: After considering my coding options and how I'm still stuck on the random quotes machine, I decided to apply my new Wikipedia API skills I picked up on Udacity to the FCC's Wikipedia Project. Thankfully the skills are transferrable and I have a very basic CodePen that meets the basic use cases. You can search for wikipedia articles, see a list and get a random article if you want.

Call this version 0.9. It could look better. I'd also like to bring up suggested search terms. So tomorrow will be focused on aesthetics. Once done, improve the functionality a bit more.

### Day 63: December 14, 2017 - Time spent, 1 hour

**Today's Progress**:  Learned ways Ajax requests can go wrong. 

**Thoughts**: Ok, so lessons learned in one API aren't necessarily applicable to others. I'm still stumped on the random quote machine. I can load wikipedia data into CodePen, but it doesn't like the https version of forismatic I found. Trying to use a callback function just got me mime type errors. Though only with forismatic. Wikipedia grooves with callbacks. 

Will try more read/search tomorrow. Perhaps look for other code sources. Or maybe I'll try playing with the national archives API instead.

### Day 62: December 13, 2017 - Time spent, 1 hour

**Today's Progress**:  Completed Udacity Intro to Ajax class. Tweaked Move Companion App in preparation for future hosting. Fixed Wikipedia error handling. Learned that the WAVE Evaluation tool doesn't seem to work on local files.

**Thoughts**: I took the Udacity Intro to Ajax class because several people at Free Code Camp (FCC) and on Twitter recommended it. So do I if you're interested in getting hands on experience with APIs. I definitely need more practice but I feel comfortable with the basics. 

I had a problem with error handling Wikipedia content. It turned out that JSONP doesn't allow you to just tack on an "error" or "fail" function. So the Udacity instructor included a neat trick involving setting a timeout that ended in an error message AND a line that canceled the timeout if wikipedia content returned. It worked great! 

The app itself is ok. I can see several ways to make it better and once I get it web posted, I ought to check it for mobile access. Maybe also put the photo, NYT articles and Wikipedia entries into Bootstrap containers. 

Also, I want to give it a go over for accessibility, but the web-based WAVE Evaluation tool doesn't work on local files. So that will have to wait till I get it web hosted.

Looking back on my list from yesterday:

1. finish the Udacity course, which still has a few sections.
2. Edit my app so that the street view does not fill the background.
3. Look for other accessibility issues with WAVE Evaluation tool (if that can be done with local files)
4. Fix error handling for the wikipedia articles. 
5. Get this project hosted on Github Pages and work out the inevitable posting glitiches

It looks like I knocked out 1,2 and 4. Not bad for working on this project in the Seattle-Tacoma airport after waking up at 2:30am. 

From here, I'm thinking I'll go back to the FCC Random Quote Machine so I can use my knowledge of APIs outside of the fairly careful guidance of Udacity.

### Day 61: December 12, 2017 - Time spent, 1 hour 30 minutes

**Today's Progress**:  Figured out how to get wikipedia data of my choosing, then formatted and inserted that data into my moving companion app for my Udacity Intro to Ajax class. Committed working code to GitHub.

**Thoughts**: It's a joy to figure something out. It always is. To get to that point, I had to review searching in the Wikimedia/Wikipedia API, use a great tool called JSON-Handle to better see how wikipedia data was structured, and spend some time figuring out how loops were going to help me out. 

JSON-Handle was particularly helpful because it not only presents JSON data in a nice outline, but it shows you the exact bracket notation of an element when you click on it. I really needed that functionality today because unlike the New York Times, Wikipedia does not name the arrays it passes back to you. It also packages titles, snippets and URLs into completely separate (objects? Arrays?) instead of the New York Times approach of passing you a single object of muliple arrays for each article. 

Next steps are:

1. finish the Udacity course, which still has a few sections.
2. Edit my app so that the street view does not fill the background.
3. Look for other accessibility issues with WAVE Evaluation tool (if that can be done with local files)
4. Fix error handling for the wikipedia articles. 
5. Get this project hosted on Github Pages and work out the inevitable posting glitiches

Tomorrow is a travel day for me. I've got long enough layovers that I'm hopeful of getting at least an hour's coding in. Then I'm with family for the holidays. We'll have to see how that affects. Wish me well in finding an appropriate coding/family balance for the rest of the month.

### Day 60: December 1, 2017 - Time spent, 1 hour 15 minutes

**Today's Progress**:  Figured out how to get some data from Wikipedia API. Learned anew importance of callbacks

**Thoughts**: Wikipedia API. Harder than it looks. I went through the Undacity tutorial, read through Ajax documentation and the Wikimedia/Wikipedia API documentation and tried several variants of Ajax requests. Not only did they not work, but they erased my other APIs display. eventually I found a tutorial on Wikipedia/Ajax tutorial that showed me what I was doing wrong. I needed to add ```&callback=?``` to the end of my calling URL. I knew that I was passing JSONP through a function and saw the term callbacks in documentation, but handn't thought that it needed to go into the URL. Call me n00b. 

Stil some more work to do with my function, but I feel like I'm on the right track. And my page isn't broken. I suppose another takeaway is that every API is different.

### Day 59: December 10, 2017 - Time spent, 1 hour

**Today's Progress**:  Completed successful display of New York Times API data within moving app. Successfuly "failed" application gracefully. 

**Thoughts**: It was easy enough to find the proper way to deal with quote marks. After that it was a simple matter of creating the list item string to display my articles. I wound up with:

```
//Put articles into HTML
$(".article-list").append("<li> <a href=\"" + items[i].web_url + "\"" + "target=\"_blank\" >" + items[i].headline.main + "</a>" + "</br>" + items[i].byline.original + "</br>" + "Snippet: " + items[i].snippet + "</br>" + "Word count: " + items[i].word_count + "</li>");
```
Ok. Not totally simple and I did need to read it over a few times. But it works beautifully. Between this and the getJSON method I learned, I feel reasonably confident in extracting and displaying API data from those APIs that support JSON and JSON-P. Which is all I wanted from the Free Code Camp (FCC) JSON APIs and Ajax but didn't get. 

My plans are to finish the Udacity course, go back to FCC and buld the random quote machine, and then probably noodle around with the National Archives Catalog API. From reading https://github.com/usnationalarchives/Catalog-API/blob/master/search_and_export.md I see it supports JSON. 

For now, the next immediate step is to work with the Wikipedia API. Then I'll finalize the "move companion" to change the image from backgound to loading at the top because I do not like the readability of text against the photo backgrounds.

One final thought on this day is that at some point I'm going to set to set up a special file of developer keys outside of GitHub. Or upgrade my subscription.

### Day 58: December 9, 2017 - Time spent, 1 hour 40 minutes

**Today's Progress**:  Successfully picked out just the fields I needed from my New York Times API/JSON query. Used jQuery append method to get headlines on my "moving companion app" page. 

**Thoughts**: Now that I can find the data I want using APIs with JSON, now the challenge is to display it in my web page. I looked through several different ways of displaying items before settling on JQuery's append method as the one I found most comprehensible and which did not totally replace text with every loop iteration. So now I have a list of headlines that display on my page in list item format. I tried to get them web linked, but I'm having issues getting append() to handle quote marks. I don't think I'm escaping the quote marks correctly. I want to get that part figured out because one of my future projects will be displaying images gathered with APIs and I'll definitely need ```<img src="some image url">``` then. Once I get quote mark handling sorted, it SEEMS like a simple matter of formatting my other fields into a list item. Then I can check off that part of the Udacity "Intro to Ajax" course and move on to the Wikipedia part, which I assume will also help me with the Free Code Camp (FCC) Wikipedia Viewer challenge.

### Day 57: December 8, 2017 - Time spent, 1 hour 15 minutes

**Today's Progress**:  Worked more with New York Times API. Learned to retrieve just the fields I wanted. Found a great video on addressing specific chucks of data within the big data blob "response." 

**Thoughts**: I was really flailing around trying to extract particular bits of New York Times articles from the big "response" blob containing objects, arrays, etc: 

```
[object Object]: {copyright: "Copyright (c) 2017 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.", response: Object, status: "OK"}
copyright: "Copyright (c) 2017 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved."
       response: Object
           docs: Array
               0: Object

                    byline: Object

                    headline: Object
                      content_kicker: null
                      kicker: null
                      main: "A $40 Toll to Drive 10 Miles? It Happened on Virginiaâ€™s I-66"
                      name: null
                      print_headline: "Tolls Rise In Virginia With Flow Of Traffic"
                      seo: null
                      sub: null

                    __proto__: Object
                   score: 1
                   web_url: "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/us/i66-toll-virginia-washington.html"
                   word_count: 789
```
Then I found a YouTube video by The Coding Train. He showed the process of getting API data, which I already knew, but then he worked through the structure of the response. The keys are 1) To address an item, you chain the hierarchy through dot notation and 2) array objects in JSON can be addressed through array notation. So finding the first "main" headline becomes:

```data.response.docs[0].headline.main```

I confirmed this works and know I think I'm in a position to complete the New York Times portion of "My Moving Companion" the next time I code. This will also help me with the Free Code Camp (FCC) Random Quote Machine once I go back to it.

### Day 56: December 7, 2017 - Time spent, 1 hour

**Today's Progress**:  Got a New York Times developer key, successfully retrieved data from Article Search API. Got a feel for just how complex JSON data could be. Figured out the data elements I want to bring into the "moving companion app."

**Thoughts**: I am really like this Udacity "Intro to Ajax" course. It is really coding heavy so I don't feel like it's a cheat to be using it for my #100DaysOfCode. The instructor gives brief overviews, points you to helpful documentation and then tells you to come back when you have the code working. There's a link to the class forum if that doesn't go well.

I'm impressed with the New York Times API. Aside from decent documentation, it actually has a form to help you build your Ajax requests. It took a little bit of looking at that and my class materials to translate the Times' Ajax query into the $.getJSON I was supposed to use, but I got it. Also got it to accept my city input. 

My next step is to parse the tsumani of data that comes with every record. Their JSON results are rather like a set of nested boxes. You get an object with an array of stories and there are some sub arrays within each story. It's a considerably more complex structure than the ones listed in the JSON.parse() function examples I've seen so far. I'm not discouraged though. Three days ago I could not figure out how to draw ANYTHING out of an API. So having too much data is actually a nice problem to have.

### Day 55: December 6, 2017 - Time spent, 1 hour 15 minutes

**Today's Progress**:  Learned how to gather information from a form and put them in variables. Got Google Streetview requests working on my "moving information app" for the Intro to Ajax course on Udacity.

**Thoughts**: This was a good day, even though progress was slow. I now have the skill of getting user input to make something happen and I've used that in the Google StreetView API. While not an Ajax request, it's a start with APIs. Part of why it took me so long is that while the project calls for street and city, Google doesn't always show a photo when the state isn't entered as well. So my own address failed. Quietly. I was using my own address because I couldn't remember how to spell Pennsylvania. After seeing several forum posts that used variations of my solution, I broke down and put in the White House address. And the street view part worked! So I went back and put in my address WITH the state after my city and that worked too!

The course is having me work on my laptop, but once I'm done, I hope to put the app on GitHub pages. I say "hope" because I don't know yet if the New York Times or Wikipedia APIs are https. If they're not, then they won't work on Github pages or CodePen.

### Day 54: December 5, 2017 - Time spent, 1 hour

**Today's Progress**:  Solved my internet woes. Learned a bit more about making Ajax requests and how to use my Chrome Developer Tools better. Started Intro to Ajax class on Udacity. 

**Thoughts**: Last night I figured my intermittant internet issues were linked to Google BackUp and Sync trying to sync ALL. THE. THINGS in my photos folders at once. Putting it on pause gave me steady internet. Turning it back on freaks out my router lights. So problem solved for now.

On the coding front. I played around a bit more with what I had yesterday, but still couldn't get a quotes API to return data. So I'm going to build up my Ajax knowledge with a course
